## Details

- User inputs a valid number to create a default grid (column number = row one) of `false` checkboxes
- After checking specific checkbox, the console will print current grid's values following a 2-dimentional array, for example, if user check the first checkbox in the first row: `[[true, false] [false, false]]`
